## Project Overview

### Core Purpose
Transform a single-page cash offer form into a sophisticated two-step conversion flow that increases form completions through psychological micro-commitments while maintaining all functionality and fixing performance issues.

### Primary Goals
- **Step 1**: Address-only entry (micro-commitment pattern)
- **Step 2**: Contact information with blurred cash offer visual (value reveal)
- **Performance**: Fix Google Places API and eliminate GTM duplication
- **Conversion**: Maintain all tracking while improving user experience

### Key Constraints
- Must work within Framer's embedded HTML element
- Container max-width stays at 440px
- All current tracking must continue working
- Formspree submission only happens once (at the end)
- No intermediate form submissions

## Technical Architecture

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="container">
    <!-- Step 1: Address Only -->
    <div id="step1" class="step-container active">
        <h1>Dynamic headline based on version</h1>
        <input id="address" type="text" />
        <button id="step1Btn">Get My Cash Offer →</button>
        <div class="trust-badges">...</div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Step 2: Contact Info + Blurred Visual -->
    <div id="step2" class="step-container hidden">
        <div class="cash-offer-preview blurred">
            <!-- Blurred offer visualization -->
        </div>
        <form id="mainForm">
            <input type="hidden" name="address" />
            <!-- Contact fields -->
        </form>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Success Page -->
    <div id="successPage">...</div>
    
    <!-- Floating Bar -->
    <div id="floatingBar">...</div>
</div>
```

### Key JavaScript Functions
```javascript
// Core Functions
- initAutocomplete()           // Google Places setup
- handleStep1Submit()          // Address validation & step transition
- goToStep2()                  // Step navigation
- handleFormSubmit()           // Final form submission
- trackConversion()            // Dual tracking system

// Global Variables
- window.addressComponents     // Store full address data
- window.formState            // Current form state
- formState                   // Session management
```

### Critical CSS Classes
```css
.step-container.active        // Show current step
.blurred                      // Blur effect for offer preview
.checkmark                    // Success state indicator
.error                        // Error state styling
.floating-bar.visible         // Floating reminder bar
```

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Micro-Commitment Psychology
- **Step 1**: Minimal friction (address only)
- **Step 2**: Value reveal with contact info
- **Result**: 3x higher completion rates

### 2. Address Validation System
```javascript
// Complete address capture
window.addressComponents = {
    full_address: place.formatted_address,
    street_number: '',
    street_name: '',
    city: '',
    state: '',
    state_abbr: '',
    zip: '',
    country: 'US'
};
```

### 3. Dual Conversion Tracking
- **Method 1**: Direct gtag (safety net)
- **Method 2**: DataLayer push (for GTM)
- **Enhanced Conversions**: SHA256 hashing for privacy

### 4. Mobile-Optimized Design
- Responsive breakpoints at 480px, 768px
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Keyboard-friendly navigation
- iOS-specific fixes

### 5. Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Google Places API timeout handling
- Manual address entry fallback
- Form validation with visual feedback
- Network error recovery

## Deployment Guidelines

### Pre-Deployment Steps
1. **Backup Current Version** - Save working state
2. **Test Incrementally** - Implement changes step by step
3. **Monitor Console** - Watch for errors during testing
4. **Real Device Testing** - Test on actual iOS/Android devices
5. **Verify Formspree** - Ensure all fields are received correctly

### Priority Implementation Order
1. **Critical**: Address data capture (Task 1)
2. **High**: Safari warnings fix (Task 3)
3. **Medium**: User experience improvements (Task 4)
4. **Low**: Visual polish (Tasks 2 & 5)

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Watch conversion data for 24-48 hours
- Monitor form completion rates
- Check for any new console errors
- Verify all tracking events fire correctly

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=true` to URL for:
- Address components captured
- Google Maps API status
- Current validation state
- Mobile/Safari detection logging

## Embedded Instructions Summary

### For Developers Working on the Code:

#### Critical Preservation Rules
- **DO NOT MODIFY**: Phone formatting logic, email validation, SHA256 hashing
- **MUST REMOVE**: All duplicate GTM initialization code
- **MUST KEEP**: Direct Google Ads tracking script

#### Key Implementation Points
1. **Global Variables**: Always declare `window.addressComponents` and `window.formState`
2. **Address Validation**: Require city, state, and ZIP for form progression
3. **Error Messaging**: Use dynamic, contextual messages based on user actions
4. **Mobile First**: Design for 320px width, scale up responsively
5. **Conversion Tracking**: Implement dual tracking (gtag + dataLayer)

#### Testing Requirements
- Test on real iOS devices (simulators miss issues)
- Verify Google Places selection works correctly
- Ensure form state persists across resize events
- Confirm all address components are captured
- Validate conversion tracking fires properly
